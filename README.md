# Magnitude_Square_Verilog_FPGA
In this repository I have shared the magnitude square module for 32-bit samples, the design is implemented in a pipeline fashion with verilog and implemented on FPGA.
The design consists of Carry select adders and booth multipliers which are efficient digital circuits, these can be further optimized.
All the implementation files along with test script given in the attached zip file.
